# Welcome to AntiLaby Rework!
### AntiLaby is a Spigot plugin by [NathanNr](https://github.com/NathanNr/) and [heisluft](https://github.com/heisluft) to disable functions of the [LabyMod](https://www.labymod.net/)

## IMORTANT:
This is a reworked AntiLaby version. It can contain unfixed bugs and is in some points not compatible with the downloadable version of AntiLaby.
Use with caution as it is not fully tested.
The stable version of AntiLaby can be found [here](https://github.com/NathanNr/AntiLaby)

######Also, AntiLaby uses Java 8 from now on!
